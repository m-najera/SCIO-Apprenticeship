    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is a little calculator that let's you find out which of 2 unit setups will deal the most damage to an enemy.</p>
    <p>The results are just an aproximation. For more detailed information about the damage calculation please visit <a href="https://exvius.gamepedia.com/Mechanics#Damage">EXVIUS WIKI</a></p>
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>You need to input the stats of your unit and the stats of the enemy you are facing.</p>
    <h3>ATK/MAG</h3>
    <p>Your unit's ATTACK if your unit deals physical damage.</p>
    <p>Your unit's MAGIC if your unit deals magical damage.</p>
    <h3>BONUS%</h3>
    <p>Your unit's bonus killers for the type of damage they deal.</p>
    <h3>ELEMENTS</h3>
    <p>The element(s) of your weapon(s) if your unit deals physical damage.</p>
    <p>Or the element(s) of your spell if your unit deals magical damage.</p>
    <h3>DEF/SPR</h3>
    <p>The enemy's DEFENSE if your unit deals physical damage.</p>
    <p>The enemy's SPIRIT if your unit deals magical damage.</p>
    <p>If you don't know the enemy's DEF/SPR, you can let it at 1. This is manly to get an aproximation of the damage you would deal.</p>
    <h3>RESISTANCES</h3>
    <p>Here goes each of your enemy's resitances. If the enemy is weak to an element the value is negative (-100)</p>
